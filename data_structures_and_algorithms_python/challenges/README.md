## 3-First-in, First out Animal Shelter.
## Feature Tasks
* Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
* Implement the following methods:
1- enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
2- dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

## 4-Multi-bracket Validation.

* function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean * representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:

1. Round Brackets : ()
2. Square Brackets : []
3. Curly Brackets : {}

## 5- Insertion_sort:
### Challenge Summary
* Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

* tested implementation of Insertion Sort based on the pseudocode provided.
**Pseudocode**
```
  InsertionSort(int[] arr)
  
    FOR i = 1 to arr.length
    
      int j <-- i - 1
      int temp <-- arr[i]
      
      WHILE j >= 0 AND temp < arr[j]
        arr[j + 1] <-- arr[j]
        j <-- j - 1
        
      arr[j + 1] <-- temp
```
### Challenge Description
* Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code
* Convert the pseudo-code into working code in your language
Present a complete set of working tests

### Approach & Efficiency
* Time: O(n^2)
The basic operation of this algorithm is comparison. This will happen n * (n-1) number of times…concluding the algorithm to be n squared.
* Space: O(1)
No additional space is being created. This array is being sorted in place…keeping the space at constant O(1).>

## 6- merge_sort:
### Challenge Summary
* Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

* Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Merge Sort based on the pseudocode provided.
**Pseudocode**
```
  
ALGORITHM Mergesort(arr)
    DECLARE n <-- arr.length
           
    if n > 1
      DECLARE mid <-- n/2
      DECLARE left <-- arr[0...mid]
      DECLARE right <-- arr[mid...n]
      // sort the left side
      Mergesort(left)
      // sort the right side
      Mergesort(right)
      // merge the sorted left and right sides together
      Merge(left, right, arr)

ALGORITHM Merge(left, right, arr)
    DECLARE i <-- 0
    DECLARE j <-- 0
    DECLARE k <-- 0

    while i < left.length && j < right.length
        if left[i] <= right[j]
            arr[k] <-- left[i]
            i <-- i + 1
        else
            arr[k] <-- right[j]
            j <-- j + 1
            
        k <-- k + 1

    if i = left.length
       set remaining entries in arr to remaining values in right
    else
       set remaining entries in arr to remaining values in left

```
### Challenge Description
* Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code
Convert the pseudo-code into working code in your language.

* Present a complete set of working tests.

### Approach & Efficiency
* Time: O(nlogn)
Thw worst case the runtime is O(nlogn)
* Space: O(n)
The space complexity of Merge sort is O(n). This means that this algorithm takes a lot of space and may slower down operations for the last data sets.

## 7- Quick_sort:
### Challenge Summary
* Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.
**Pseudocode**
```
ALGORITHM QuickSort(arr, left, right)
    if left < right
        // Partition the array by setting the position of the pivot value 
        DEFINE position <-- Partition(arr, left, right)
        // Sort the left
        QuickSort(arr, left, position - 1)
        // Sort the right
        QuickSort(arr, position + 1, right)

ALGORITHM Partition(arr, left, right)
    // set a pivot value as a point of reference
    DEFINE pivot <-- arr[right]
    // create a variable to track the largest index of numbers lower than the defined pivot
    DEFINE low <-- left - 1
    for i <- left to right do
        if arr[i] <= pivot
            low++
            Swap(arr, i, low)

     // place the value of the pivot location in the middle.
     // all numbers smaller than the pivot are on the left, larger on the right. 
     Swap(arr, right, low + 1)
    // return the pivot index point
     return low + 1

ALGORITHM Swap(arr, i, low)
    DEFINE temp;
    temp <-- arr[i]
    arr[i] <-- arr[low]
    arr[low] <-- temp

```
### Challenge Description
* Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code
* Convert the pseudo-code into working code in your language
* Present a complete set of working tests

### Approach & Efficiency
Time-complexity: The worst-case complexity of quicksort is O(n2) as lots of comparisons are needed in the worst condition. Whereas in mergesort, worst-case and average-case have the same complexities O(n log n).

## 10- left_join:

### Challenge Description
* Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.
* The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
* The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
* Combine the key and corresponding values (if they exist) into a new data structure according to LEFT JOIN logic.
* LEFT JOIN means all the values in the first hashmap are returned, and if values exist in the “right” hashmap, they are appended to the result row. If no values exist in the right hashmap, then some flavor of NULL should be appended to the result row.
* The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesn’t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic.
* Avoid utilizing any of the library methods available to your language.
